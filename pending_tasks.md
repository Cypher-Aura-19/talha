## Prompt 3 (Veo 3 Video): Faroe Islands Remote Base
> Animated 1950s magazine art style video with warm retro colors. The camera frames the developer, Talha, from the rear, deeply focused and facing directly towards his multi-monitor workstation. He is wearing a realistic black leather biker jacket with a highly detailed 'Sons of Anarchy' style back patch. The top rocker curve features the name 'TALHA RIZWAN' embroidered with realistic, natural thread texture and authentic weathering. To his right sits a large open window. He pauses his typing, turns his head to the right to gaze out the window. The camera flows forward, passing him and exiting the window to showcase the stunning Faroe Islands scenery—green cliffs and churning ocean—in a golden, nostalgic atmosphere.
